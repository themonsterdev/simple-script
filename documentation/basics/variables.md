# Variables

Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In our language, variables are declared using the `var` keyword.

## Declaring Variables

```our_language
var x;
var y = 10;
var name = "Alice";
```

## Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.

Example:

```our_language
var _age = 30;
var firstName = "John";
```
