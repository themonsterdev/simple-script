# Variables and Constants

Variables and constants are fundamental concepts in our programming language. Here's how you can declare and use them:

## Variables

Variables are used to store data values. You can declare a variable using the `var` keyword followed by the variable name and optional initialization:

```mylang
var x = 10;
```

# Constants

Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be changed after they are initialized. You can declare a constant using the const keyword followed by the constant name and initialization:

```mylang
const PI = 3.14;
```

Now that you know how to declare variables and constants, you can start using them in your code!
