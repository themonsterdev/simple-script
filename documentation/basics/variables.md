# Variables

Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In our language, variables are declared using the `var` keyword.

## Declaring Variables

```ts
var x
var y = 10
var name = "Alice"
```

## Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.

Example:

```ts
var _age = 30
var firstName = "John"
```
