# Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. Our programming language supports various types of operators, including:

- Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables (e.g., `=`, `+=`, `-=`).
- Comparison Operators: Compare values (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`).
- Logical Operators: Perform logical operations (e.g., `&&`, `||`, `!`).
- Bitwise Operators: Perform bitwise operations (e.g., `&`, `|`, `^`).

By understanding how operators work, you can manipulate data and control the flow of your program effectively.
