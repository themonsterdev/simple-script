# Data Types

Our programming language supports various data types for representing different kinds of values. Here are some of the most common data types:

- Integer: Represents whole numbers (e.g., `42`, `-10`).
- Float: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`).
- String: Represents sequences of characters (e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`).
- Boolean: Represents true or false values (`true`, `false`).

Additionally, the language provides support for more complex data types such as arrays, dictionaries, and custom data structures.
