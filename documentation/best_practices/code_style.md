# Code Style

Consistent code style makes your code more readable and maintainable. Here are some guidelines for writing clean code.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.

Example:

```simple_script
var firstName = "Alice"
function calculateTotal() then
    // ...
end
class Person
    // ...
end
```

## Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.

Example:

```simple_script
function exampleFunction() then
    if true then
        print("Indented code")
    end
end
```

## Comments

- Write comments to explain the purpose of code.
- Use single-line comments for short explanations and multi-line comments for detailed descriptions.

Example:

```simple_script
# This is a single-line comment

// This is a single-line comment

/**
 * This is a
 * multi-line comment
 */
```
