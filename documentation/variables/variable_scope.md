# Variable Scope

Variable scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables within a program. Here's how variable scope works in our programming language:

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
- **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope and can only be accessed within that function or block.

By understanding variable scope, you can avoid naming conflicts and manage the lifetime of your variables effectively.
