# Expressions

Expressions are combinations of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluate to a single value. Here's an overview of expressions in our programming language:

- **Ternary Expression**: An expression that evaluates a condition and returns one of two possible values based on the result.
- **Logical Or Expression**: An expression that performs a logical OR operation on two operands.
- **Logical And Expression**: An expression that performs a logical AND operation on two operands.
- **Bitwise Or Expression**: An expression that performs a bitwise OR operation on two operands.
- **Bitwise Xor Expression**: An expression that performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on two operands.
- **Bitwise And Expression**: An expression that performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands.
- **Equality Expression**: An expression that compares two values for equality or inequality.
- **Comparison Expression**: An expression that compares two values and returns true or false based on the comparison result.
- **Shift Expression**: An expression that performs bitwise shifting of the bits in a value.
- **Additive Expression**: An expression that performs addition or subtraction of two values.
- **Multiplicative Expression**: An expression that performs multiplication, division, or modulo operation on two values.
- **Unary Expression**: An expression that consists of a single operand and an operator.
- **Primary Expression**: An expression that cannot be decomposed into simpler expressions.

By understanding expressions and how they evaluate, you can write more complex and expressive code in our programming language.
