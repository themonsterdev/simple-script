# Getting Started

This section will help you write your first program and understand the basic concepts of Simple Script.

## Your First Program

Let's start with a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```ts
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Running Your Program

1. Save the above code in a file named hello_world.txt.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the program using the command:

```bash
interpreter.exe hello_world.txt
```

You should see the output: Hello, World!
