# Getting Started

This section will help you write your first program and understand the basic concepts of our programming language.

## Your First Program

Let's start with a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```our_language
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Running Your Program

1. Save the above code in a file named hello_world.our.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the program using the command:

```our_language
our_language hello_world.our
```

You should see the output: Hello, World!
