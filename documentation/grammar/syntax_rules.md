# Syntax Rules

Our language has a set of rules that define its syntax. Here are some of the most important ones:

## Variables

- Variables must be declared before use.
- Use the `var` keyword to declare a variable.

Example:

```our_language
var x = 10;
var name = "Alice";
```

## Functions

- Functions are defined using the function keyword.
- Parameters are enclosed in parentheses () and the body is enclosed in curly braces {}.

Example:

```our_language
function greet(name) {
    print("Hello, " + name);
}
```

## Control Structures

- Use if, else if, and else for conditional statements.
- Loops can be created using for, while, and do while.

Example:

```our_language
if (x > 0) {
    print("Positive");
} else {
    print("Non-positive");
}
```
