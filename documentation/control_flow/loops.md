# Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. Simple Script supports `while`, and `do while` loops.

## While Loop

```simple_script
var i = 0
while i < 5 then
    print(`Iteration: ${i}`)
    i = i + 1
end
```

## Do While Loop

```simple_script
var i = 0
do
    print(`Iteration: ${i}`)
    i = i + 1
while i < 5
```
