# Booleans

Booleans are a fundamental data type in our programming language, representing true or false values. Here's how you can use booleans in your code:

```ts
var isTrue = true;
var isFalse = false;
```

Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements and logical expressions to control the flow of your program.
